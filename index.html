            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Heritage Hats was born to express my passion for learning and carrying on the skills and traditions of the traditional Southwestern culture. After moving to Phoenix from Rockford, Illinois, in 1981, I befriended two older gentlemen, Steve Speros and George Falkedes, who became my mentors and taught me the techniques and skills necessary to become a restoration expert. I am proud to have inherited their original cleaning and blocking equipment from 1912! While perfecting my methods, I started selling western hats from my pickup on the weekends and opened my first retail store in 1983. Today, Heritage Hats is the largest hat store in Arizona. It has various hats, including Western felt and straws, fedora felt and straws, panamas, and more. We know a hat is an expression of your unique personality and style.</p>

            <h2>Hat Types</h2>
            <p>Hats are an icon of the Arizona desert and have been part of the tradition of the West since the early 20th Century. We have a large selection of westerns, fedoras, Panama's, Australians caps, and other hats.
