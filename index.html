				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>Heritage Hats was born to express my passion for learning and carrying on the skills and traditions
					of
					the traditional Southwestern culture. After moving to Phoenix from Rockford, Illinois, in 1981, I
					befriended two older gentlemen, Steve Speros and George Falkedes, who became my mentors and taught
					me
					the techniques and skills necessary to become a restoration expert. I am proud to have inherited
					their
					original cleaning and blocking equipment from 1912! While perfecting my methods, I started selling
					western hats from my pickup on the weekends and opened my first retail store in 1983. Today,
					Heritage
					Hats is the largest hat store in Arizona. It has various hats, including Western felt and straws,
					fedora
					felt and straws, panamas, and more. We know a hat is an expression of your unique personality and
					style.

			<h2>Hat Types</h2>
			<p>Hats are an icon of the Arizona desert and have been part of the tradition of the West since the early
				20th Century. We have a large selection of westerns, fedoras, Panama's, Australians caps, and other
				hats. Hats also provide protection against skin cancer, so we carry brands that offer UPF of 50+ and a
				5" brim for added protection. We also know that a hat expresses your unique personality and style. Check
				out these options to help you find the perfect hat! In addition to our hand crafted hats, we also offer

						<h4>Felt Hats</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Use a gum eraser to remove deep stains. If sponging does not work, try sanding with
								100-grit
								paper,
								moving it gently counterclockwise. Never press into the hat or the hat into the paper.
							</li>
							<li>Do not take your hat on and off by the crown. Instead, use the front and back of the
								brim
								next
								to
								the crown bend.</li>
							<li>Do not set your hat down on its brim; it will flatten and lose shape.</li>

				<h2>What Our Customers Say</h2>
				<p>I recently took my grandfather's hat to Heritage to have it cleaned. My grandfather passed on nearly
					25
					years ago and he wore this tweed hat everyday in the winter in Chicago. The hat was very old and
					very
					dirty and I was nervous about having it cleaned. Heritage cleaned it up very well and it looks
					great. I
					plan to hang it on the wall in my office. I'm willing to bet this is one of the best hat cleaning
					shops
					in the country. Take your hats here for cleaning and shop around for something new too. You won't be
					disappointed."</p>

			<div class="quote-2">
				<p>I visited Heritage Hats while in town prior to a holiday weekend and brought in two of my father's
					hats
					that needed to be cleaned and blocked. I requested them in time for me to head out after the holiday
					and Rich not only had them looking brand new, he delivered early (working over the holiday weekend)
					and
					provided a custom fit. Next time I need a hat, I am heading to Heritage Hats in Phoenix. Thank you
					Rich."</p>
